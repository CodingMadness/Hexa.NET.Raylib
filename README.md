# Hexa.NET.Raylib

A .NET Wrapper for Raylib (v 5.6.dev for those who want to stay up2date when it comes to raylib-updates);
generated with the HexaGen code generator.HexaGen allows users to access native libraries easily and with high performance.
This is a fork from the original 'Hexa.Net.Raylib' created and maintained by 'Juna Meinhold'

## Features

- **Minimal Wrapper**: Provides a direct, 1:1 mapping to the Raylib C functions, staying true to the original API.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works across all platforms supported by Raylib, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Pre-Built Native Libraries**: The package includes pre-built native libraries, so you don't need to worry about installing Raylib separately.
- **High-Performance**: The library uses a static vtable, which provides less overhead then DllImport/LibraryImport and faster startup times.
